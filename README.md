ArcGIS-map-and-compass
======================

Testing ArcGIS https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/ maps to create HTML5 map and compass showing your heading


Test it here: http://lauri-kaariainen.github.io/ArcGIS-map-and-compass/

note: compass works right in vertical view only, it'll point in the same direction as the 'head' of your phone.
